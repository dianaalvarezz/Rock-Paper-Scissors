# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Introduction
This project is a simple rock paper scissors game written in C++. As someone who is just embarking on my journey into programming
in C++, I created this game as a learning exercise. It's designed to be straightforward yet engaging, asking the player to choose 
between rock, paper or scissors. At the same time the game will make a selection at random. Once the player makes the their 
choice, the game will tell them what the computer randomly selected and if they won or lost and why. 

## Learning Journey

This game is a testament to the initial steps of my programming journey, emphasizing the learning process and the application of 
fundamental C++ concepts. As such, it's crafted with simplicity in mind, making it accessible for other beginners who might
be interested in exploring basic project development and coding practices.

## How to Play

To play the game, you will be prompted to select either rock, paper, or scissors. The game at the same time will select either rock, 
paper, or scissors at random. Your goal is to make a selection that will beat the computers choice based on the traditional rules
of rock paper scissors game. Once you imput your choice the game will then tell you whether you won or lost and why.
